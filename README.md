# datafolioProjects
## Introduction
This GitHub repository serves as a central location for all of the code and queries used in the portfolio projects created by me. The purpose is to showcase the analyst's technical skills and understanding of various data analysis tools and techniques to potential employers and students.

I hope that this repository will be helpful for those looking to land their dream job in data analysis. Please, feel free to take the code and queries and make them their own, finding their own insights, and building upon them.

Welcome and see you soon :3
